How to run the service app (will be available at localhost port 5000):

from the command line:
make run

File descriptions:

README - short descriptions of each file and instructions for running the service
Makefile - simple Makefile to interact with provided example code
requirements.txt - list of python requirements to be installed via pip

note, in lieu of writing tests for api layer, which would entail building mock requests, I opted to include a Swagger API page to test directly with:
     http://127.0.0.1:5000/ui/ ( full swagger API test harness page)


This service is structured as follows:

divvy-dose-api
divvy-dose-api.yml
  The routing declarations for endpoints in openAPI yaml format. Used to generate swagger UI as well. (opted instead of putting @app.route() annotations in api layer)

- api
  controller layer where requests are parsed and validated. Handles all http response building, building DTOs from Json

- dto
  dto definitions for the api
  
- service
  - repository_service
    service layer where all business logic occurs. DTOs are input/output
- client
  - api_clients.py  Api clients to call github and bitbucket apis
 
- cache
  - sample in-memory cache maps to store api calls
